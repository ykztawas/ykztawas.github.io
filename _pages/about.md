Hi, I am a PhD student under supervision of professor [Juergen Gall](https://pages.iai.uni-bonn.de/gall_juergen/) and I apply deep learning to semantic scene parsing for autonomous systems. 

Recently, we introduced the new task of [Task Driven Object Detection](https://coco-tasks.github.io/) including a public dataset and a first proposed method. 

Earlier, we proposed a dataset and method for (weakly supervised) segmentation of functional parts of objects ([Weakly Supervised Affordance Detection](https://github.com/ykztawas/Weakly-Supervised-Affordance-Detection)).
